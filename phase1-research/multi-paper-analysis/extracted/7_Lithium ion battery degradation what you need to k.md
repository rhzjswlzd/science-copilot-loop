The expansion of lithium-ion batteries from consumer electronics to larger-scale transport and energy
storage applications has made understanding the many mechanisms responsible for battery degradation
increasingly important. The literature in this complex topic has grown considerably; this perspective aims
to distil current knowledge into a succinct form, as a reference and a guide to understanding battery
degradation. Unlike other reviews, this work emphasises the coupling between the diﬀerent mechanisms
and the diﬀerent physical and chemical approaches used to trigger, identify and monitor various
mechanisms, as well as the various computational models that attempt to simulate these interactions.
Degradation is separated into three levels: the actual mechanisms themselves, the observable
consequences at cell level called modes and the operational eﬀects such as capacity or power fade.
Five principal and thirteen secondary mechanisms were found that are generally considered to be the
cause of degradation during normal operation, which all give rise to five observable modes. A flowchart
illustrates the diﬀerent feedback loops that couple the various forms of degradation, whilst a table is
presented to highlight the experimental conditions that are most likely to trigger specific degradation
mechanisms. Together, they provide a powerful guide to designing experiments or models for
investigating battery degradation.
Introduction
Understanding battery degradation is critical for cost-eﬀective
decarbonisation of both energy grids1 and transport.2 However,
battery degradation is often presented as complicated and
diﬃcult to understand. This perspective aims to distil the
knowledge gained by the scientific community to date into a
succinct form, highlighting the minimum number of papers
that need to be read in order to understand lithium ion battery
(LIB) degradation. Other recent reviews in this area include
Kabir et al.,3 providing a classification for degradation mechanisms
and modes and briefly covering key experimental techniques;
Hapuarachichi et al.,5 having a strong focus on in situ experimental
techniques for assessing anode degradation; Woody et al.,6 drawing
out implications for best practise in LIB use and Pender et al.,7
covering the degradation of electrode materials for the extended
LIB family. This perspective provides a simple and consistent
classification for the main mechanisms aﬀecting lithium inter-
calation materials, draws out the link between degradation
mechanisms and their triggering conditions and highlights the
interconnection between various mechanisms, presenting the com-
plexity through updated figures and tables in an accessible way.
The rapid market expansion for LIBs8 is driving down cost,
but making LIBs last longer is just as important. This improves
the lifetime economics, enables longer warranties4 and dilutes
the environmental impacts associated with raw material extraction
and manufacturing.9,10 Understanding battery degradation is key
to increasing operational lifetime. Being able to accurately predict
battery end-of-life (EoL) enables the risks of thermal runaway to be
minimised.11
With time and use, the storage capacity of LIBs diminishes
and the internal resistance increases,12 due to a wide range of
degradation mechanisms, some occurring simultaneously, or
triggering further mechanisms. Some usage patterns and operating
conditions lead to rapid degradation by one or more processes and
the interplay between mechanisms is still not well understood.13
This perspective presents a state-of-the-art picture of the most

prominent degradation processes, presenting the latest under-
standing of each mechanism, experimental techniques and
conditions that can trigger and/or exacerbate the degradation
caused by that mechanism and the models which have been
proposed to simulate it.
From a user’s perspective, there are three main external
stress factors that influence degradation: temperature, state of
charge (SoC) and load profile. The relative importance of each
of these factors varies depending on the chemistry, form factor
and historic use conditions, among others. Works such as Birkl
et al.14 have highlighted how these stress factors can influence
the underpinning physical degradation processes, with models
such as those reviewed in Reniers et al.,13 showing how individual
mechanisms can be described. In general, temperature is the most
significant stress factor, where deviations from the typical 25 1C
can lead to accelerated failure.15 Higher SoC operation accelerates
degradation, due to the relationship between the electrode
potentials and the rate of parasitic side reactions, while higher
current operation increases the likelihood of failure, due to
mechanical stresses developing in the battery during cycling,
but also promotion of lithium plating during charge.
The magnitude of these influences is also dependent on
secondary factors, such as subtle manufacturing defects. Harris
et al.,16 for instance, demonstrated the variability in lifetime of
24 nominally identical pouch cells, all cycled with the same
load profile. While the root cause of this variability is still
debated, slight variations in manufacturing conditions are
likely to have played a role, thus highlighting the need for
statistically significant sample sizes. This is further amplified by
sensitivity to testing conditions often not controlled nor measured,
such as the application of external pressure to pouch cells or
thermal gradients that build up, due to internal heat generation.
Recently,17,18 attention has been drawn to the importance of
path dependence,19 i.e. the order in which the various degradation
mechanisms are triggered through either calendar ageing, occur-
ring while the battery is at rest, or cycle ageing, when the battery is
in use or being charged. In real world usage patterns, periods of
rapid (dis)charging may be interspersed with slower (dis)charging
or periods of idleness, therefore investigations of this aspect are
needed for more accurate lifetime prediction.
Given the topical nature of LIBs, many publications have
presented models to describe their degradation. However, in
the vast majority of cases, these are done in isolation of other
mechanisms, ignoring their interplay. To date, the authors are
not aware of any fully comprehensive model capturing all eﬀects
and their influences on each other. Some notable works have
attempted to link mechanisms together, such as Yang et al.,20
who showed how the growth of the solid–electrolyte interphase
(SEI) layer leads to pore blockage and subsequently an increase
in the rate of lithium plating, ultimately leading to a non-linear
drop-off in cell capacity. Beyond the importance of coupling the
interactions between the various degradation mechanisms, the
importance of path-dependency – i.e. which mechanism was
triggered first – is also often understated; with the sequence of
events being an important factor in determining life, especially
at higher current loads.17 These complex interactions often cannot
be captured accurately with empirical or semi-empirical models,
instead needing physics-based models.
In this perspective, we cover the main mechanisms occurring
during normal operating conditions, within the safety limits
defined by the manufacturer’s specifications. The structure of
the perspective has three main sections, starting with descriptions
of the mechanisms, their consequences and interactions, followed
by experimental techniques for characterising and triggering these
mechanisms. The third section covers the state-of-the art in
modelling these mechanisms, including a discussion on models
which attempt to capture the interactions between them.
Clarification of nomenclature
There are six main components of a typical battery: two current
collectors in contact with the two electrodes, between which
redox reactions take place, allowing charge/discharge; a porous
separator, preventing short circuiting between the two electrodes
while allowing charged ions to migrate through; and the electrolyte,
which enables facile charge transfer and is an additional source of
lithium ions (Li+). Fig. 1 shows these components schematically.
Within some research domains, the electrodes in the LIB are
referred to as the anode or cathode, defined from the electrodes’
role during the discharge process and then used absolutely. As
both electrodes play the role of the anode or cathode, depending
on whether the cell is charging or discharging, it is more
accurate to define them by their relative electrode potentials.
Hence, the electrode with the higher electrode potential, often
referred to as the cathode, is herein referred to as the positive
electrode (PE). It is typically a lithium transition metal (TM)
oxide material, capable of undergoing reversible delithiation of
Li+, and the limiting factor in determining the energy density of
the battery. The other electrode – an intercalation material,
usually graphite or a graphite hybrid material and sometimes
lithium titanate (LTO)22 – is often referred to as the anode, but
herein referred to as the negative electrode (NE).
Both the PE and NE are the active materials coated on metal
foils (current collectors), which serve to facilitate electron transport
to the active materials. As a cell is polarised for charging, the PE is
oxidised, causing electrons to be released to the external circuit and
Li+ to delithiate from the PE crystal structure. As the ions migrate
across the cell and through the separator to intercalate between the
layers of the NE material, electrons flow externally to the NE,
reducing it and maintaining charge neutrality. Hence, both materials
must undergo structural changes in order to accommodate Li+.
During discharge, the reverse process takes place, where the NE is
oxidised and the PE is reduced. Hence, the Li ions and electrons are
shuttled back and forth in a ‘rocking chair’ fashion for charging and
discharging the cell. This requires Li+ to be easily and reversibly
extracted from the PE and is limited by the TM oxide crystal’s ability
to maintain a stable neutral crystal structure.
Mechanisms of battery degradation
Battery degradation can be described using three tiers of detail.

changes that have occurred within the cell. Mechanisms are the
most detailed viewpoint of degradation but are also typically
the most diﬃcult to observe during battery operation. The
directly observable eﬀects of degradation are capacity fade and
power fade. Capacity fade is a reduction in the usable capacity of
the cell and power fade is a reduction of the deliverable power of
the cell after degradation. These observable eﬀects are the least
detailed viewpoint of degradation but are the easiest to measure.
As a result, many practical measures of cell degradation are of
capacity fade and power fade.
Between degradation mechanisms and observable eﬀects lie
the degradation modes: a method of grouping degradation
mechanisms, based on their overall impact on the cell’s ther-
modynamic and kinetic behaviour. We would like to highlight
four modes, all of which impact the thermodynamic behaviour
of the cell, i.e. the shape of the open-circuit voltage (OCV) curve
and the maximum theoretical capacity of the cell. Firstly, loss of
active material (LAM), occurring in both positive and negative
electrodes. This mode groups mechanisms which lead to a
reduction in the material available for electrochemical activity.
Secondly, loss of lithium inventory (LLI) groups mechanisms
resulting in a reduction of the amount of cyclable lithium
available for transport between electrodes. Thirdly, most often
associated with LLI, is stoichiometric drift, where the electrodes
become imbalanced relative to each other.21 Finally, impedance
change groups those mechanisms aﬀecting the kinetic behaviour
of the cell. Various terms have been used in the literature to
refer to this mode. Han et al.23 use the term resistance increase,
while Vetter et al.24 use the term impedance rise. All of these
terms lead to the same grouping of degradation mechanisms.
This mode was further divided by Dubarry et al.,25 who introduced
two modes termed ‘‘ohmic resistance increase’’ and ‘‘faradaic rate
degradation’’. The former arises through degradation of the
electronic conduction pathways in the cell, occurring through
mechanisms such as current collector corrosion. faradaic rate
degradation occurs primarily through electrodes not reacting with
lithium ions at the same rate as had occurred at the beginning of
life and is caused by mechanisms such as SEI growth and pore
blockage. A notable cause of impedance increase is related to the
loss of electrolyte (LE), taking place at the interface of both
electrodes due to various mechanisms, such as SEI formation,
high voltages, high temperature, lithium plating, or reaction
with moisture contamination resulting in hydrofluoric acid (HF)
formation. These are key degradation mechanisms and are
discussed in detail below. In addition, as the volume of electro-
lyte reduces, drying of pores and local areas within both
electrodes can take place, therefore LE leads to LAM, but also
leads to an increased concentration of lithium salt.
Degradation of LIBs is evidently a complex issue and this
perspective aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of the
principal degradation mechanisms aﬄicting both electrodes,
illustrated in Fig. 1. We start by discussing SEI formation and
lithium plating, which are exclusively associated with the NE.
Then we cover a host of interlinked mechanisms aﬀecting the
structure and decomposition of positive electrodes, including
the well-known formation of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI),

herein referred to as positive solid electrolyte interface (pSEI) for
consistency. Particle fracture is discussed next, aﬀecting both
electrodes, but the special case of silicon additives in negative
electrodes is also described. The final subsection discusses the
developing research area of the relationship between degradation
mechanisms and how they either positively or negatively rein-
force each other.
Although there are other mechanisms that exist, it is not the
aim of this review to extensively cover all known processes,
rather to provide the reader with a distillation of knowledge of
the mechanisms that are generally considered to be the most
important during normal operation. Other known degradation
processes include: salt precipitation, current collector corrosion,
binder decomposition, separator pore blockage, electrode-current
collector delamination and electrolyte evaporation, to name but a
few, and are covered well in other reviews.11,23,24
SEI layer growth
Principles. The SEI is a passivation layer on most NE surfaces,
having the properties of a solid electrolyte and formed when the
liquid electrolyte comes into contact with the electron-conductive
surface of the NE. This is usually operating at voltages below the
electrochemical stability window of the electrolyte,12,24 accelerat-
ing redox processes irreversibly breaking down the electrolyte,
leading to electrolyte loss. Li metal electrodes develop this SEI
layer, as well as graphite.26,27 A variety of compounds have been
observed within the SEI, for example: lithium fluoride (LiF),
lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium methyl carbonate (LiO-
CO2CH3), lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LiOCO2CH2)2 and
lithium oxide (Li2O).28
The SEI layer forms initially on the first cycle of the cell,
resulting in ca. 10% reduction in capacity, but then serves to stop
further reaction of the electrolyte at the NE. However, the thickness
of the SEI layer increases (predominantly on the graphite NE) as
the cell ages. The growth could be due to various reasons,
including diﬀusion of solvent molecules through existing SEI,
new exposed electrode surfaces which result from cracking and
deposition of side reaction products, such as plated Li and TM
ions dissolved from the PE, which react with the electrolyte to form
SEI. The SEI growth rate approximately correlates with the square
root of time;29 as the SEI thickness increases, the rate of solvent
molecule diﬀusion slows down.
Exacerbating and mitigating factors. The SEI begins to form
as soon as the NE is lithiated and exposed to the electrolyte and
will grow even if the battery is not then used.30 However, high
temperatures increase diﬀusion rates and hence also the SEI
growth rate. High currents also lead to particle cracking and
new SEI formation.31 Under normal conditions, LTO anodes do
not form an SEI layer, due to LTO being within the stability
limit of most organic electrolytes, however an SEI can form at
potentials below 1 V.32
Consequences. Capacity is irreversibly lost due to otherwise
cyclable lithium being trapped within the SEI.33 In addition, the
SEI layer is less permeable to Li+ ions than the electrolyte,
restricts electrolyte flow through pore blocking and consumes
the electrolyte solvent. All of these eﬀects increase the overall
impedance of cells, leading to power fade. While the SEI layer
itself is not thought to cause catastrophic failure, at elevated
temperatures it can decompose and contribute to a thermal
runaway event.11 SEI growth consumes the electrolyte solvents,
reducing both the amount and the conductivity of the
electrolyte.
Links to other mechanisms. (i) TM ions dissolved from the
PE are deposited on the NE, accelerating SEI growth.34
(ii) Particle and SEI cracking, caused by high cycling rates,
open up new surfaces for new SEI formation.
(iii) Plated Li can undergo additional side reactions with the
electrolyte to form more SEI,35 illustrated in Fig. 2.
(iv) LLI from the NE causes the electrodes to become
imbalanced relative to each other, stoichiometric drift21 which
can lead to excessive de-lithiation and accelerated degradation
of the PE at high SoCs.
Lithium plating
Principles. Li plating is a side reaction where metallic Li
forms on the surface of the NE instead of intercalating into it.
This can be caused by the NE surface becoming fully lithiated, in
which the Li has nowhere else to go (thermodynamic plating),36
or by fast charging, where the high electrolyte potential increases
the rate of the side reaction relative to the main intercalation
reaction (kinetic plating).37 Even at moderate charge rates, below-
freezing temperatures slow down the main intercalation reaction
enough to cause plating.38 As with any electroplating reaction,
the Li metal can be recovered through the inverse reaction,
known as stripping.37
Exacerbating and mitigating factors. Low temperatures, high
SoC, high (charge) current, high cell voltage and insuﬃcient NE
mass or electrochemically active surface area can all cause lithium
plating. It is standard practice to put 10–20% spare capacity in the
NE to prevent overcharge.35 Local overcharge can also occur at
the edges of the electrode, so spare surface area or ‘‘overhang’’
is included to minimise this.38 However, these mitigating
strategies are not enough to stop plating during fast charging,

or at below-freezing temperatures, both of which the NE in
Fig. 3 was subjected to.38 Local defects in the separator or NE
are also known to cause plating;39 these can arise from either
manufacturing defects40 as shown in Fig. 3, or during use.41
Calendar ageing is slow at low temperatures, implying that Li
plating does not occur when the battery is at equilibrium.42
However, rest periods immediately after fast charging will
favour the reaction of the plated lithium with the electrolyte
rather than its removal by stripping.43
Consequences. The plated metallic Li quickly undergoes
further side reactions with the electrolyte to form SEI.20,35,38
This SEI growth can electrically isolate the remaining Li,
forming ‘‘dead lithium’’ that cannot be recovered. Li plating
therefore has both reversible and irreversible components.
Both the additional SEI growth and dead lithium manifest as
loss of lithium inventory and reduce conductivity through pore
clogging.20 The plating of metallic lithium can lead to dendrite
growth, which can puncture the separator and cause an inter-
nal short circuit.11
Links to other mechanisms. As already mentioned, Li plating
results in further SEI growth and electrolyte solvent consumption.
Positive electrode structural change and decomposition
Principles. PE degradation is highly dependent on chemistry.
Various TM oxide materials are currently used as positive electro-
des in LIBs, including layered oxides (such as LiCoO2 and
LiNixMnyCozO2 (NMC)), spinel-type (LiMn2O4) and polyanion
oxides (such as LiFePO4).44 To limit the scope of this perspective,
we focus here on layered oxides, in particular NMC-based positive
electrodes, since they currently provide one of the highest
achievable energy densities and are one of the most prominent
in current applications.
NMC materials themselves can vary significantly in their
make-up, with diﬀerent ratios of nickel, manganese and cobalt
used in diﬀerent cells. Each of these cations, with their unique
properties, play a deciding role in the ageing and degradation
of the PE. The main degradation mechanisms for NMC positive
electrodes can be summarised as:
(i) Phase change: delithiated layered NMC structures,
composed mainly of TM (Ni, Mn and Co) oxides, decompose into
disordered spinel and rock salt phases, forming a passivation layer
at the surface of the PE solid particles and releasing oxygen
through the following process:45
LixMO2 (layered) - LixM3O4 (spinel) - LixMO (rock salt)
(i.e. metal/oxygen = 1 : 2 - 3 : 4 - 1 : 1, [O] releases in each step)
In summary: LixMO2 - LixMO + [O]; [O] + [O] - O2 (g)
where M represents TMs. The formation of spinel and rock salt
phases are thermodynamically more favourable at increasingly
delithiated states.46 Release of lattice oxygen can lead to
formation of O2 and other gaseous products, through reaction
with the electrolyte.
(ii) Oxidation of lattice oxygen: electrochemical oxidation of
oxide anions within the lattice takes place, resulting in TM
dissolution or formation of rock salt phases. LiCoO2 can only
be oxidised (delithiated) to Li0.5CoO2 before beginning to
decompose, with loss of oxygen from the crystal lattice.47
(iii) Electrolyte decomposition and loss: nickel is not known
to be stable in high oxidation states and any highly oxidised
nickel species will quickly react if in contact with the electrolyte.
This leads to Ni2+ dissolved in the electrolyte (which will form
surface films on either electrode) and electrolyte decomposition,
with consequent LE.45,48
(iv) TM/Li+ site exchange: the similar ionic radii of Li+ and
Ni2+ can lead to site switching in the PE crystal lattice (also known
as disordering), which can retard the diﬀusion of Li+ through the
electrode due to reduced inter-slab space thickness, thereby
increasing impedance.49
(v) Acid attack: electrolytes tend to be fluoride-containing,
non-aqueous organics that are highly reactive with moisture.
The presence of moisture leads to the formation of acidic
species such as HF and this leads to LE.24,48 These acid species
can then react with the PE material, resulting in the dissolution
of TM ions from the electrode:48
Acid attack: 2H+ + MO–R = M2+ + H2O + R
Sources of H+:
I: Solvent - SLo + H+ (SL+) + e
II: LiPF6 = LiF + PF5; PF5 + H2O = POF3 + 2HF; 2HF = 2H+ + 2F
where M, R and SLo/SL+ represent TMs, the residual composition of
the host PE material and solvent oxidation products, respectively.
(i) pSEI formation: surface species form on either electrode
due to the dissolution of TM ions during the above processes.
The dissolute TM ions (Ni2+/Ni3+/Ni4+, Mn3+/Mn4+, Co3+/Co4+)
react with the electrolyte to form MF2 precipitates, where M
represents TMs. The MF2 species deposit onto the PE surface to
form a layer of considerable thickness, in much the same way
as the SEI forms on the NE, following this reaction:48,50
2H+ + 2F + MO–R = MF2 (pSEI) + H2O + R

where M, R and SLo/SL+ represent TMs, the residual composition of
the host PE material and solvent oxidation products, respectively.
This process usually happens during the first cycles. However,
additional pSEI forms if the deposited layer is unstable and
breaks,51 much like the SEI-layer on the NE side. The chemical
composition of the pSEI strongly depends on the electrolyte
composition as the pSEI formation reaction consumes the proton
(H+) from the electrolyte with other solvent oxidation products
(SL+). Thus, pSEI formation and growth also contributes to
electrolyte decomposition and loss. Recent studies48,50,51 show
that, apart from TM fluoride (MF2), TM carbonates, along with
minor quantities of hydroxides and water, are the few other
species that are present in the pSEI.
Exacerbating and mitigating factors. Mechanisms (i)–(iv)
outlined above are all influenced by the chemical and structural
stability of the material. Each of the constituent TMs impart
different properties into the electrode material, with advantages
and disadvantages for each. High cobalt content results in greater
stability of the layered crystalline structure, but lower chemical
stability. LiMnO2 has a greater chemical stability due to its lower
redox potential, but suffers from structural instability, under-
going a phase change from layered to spinel structure.24 Pure
LiNiO2 electrodes are more unstable, but when mixed with Co
and Mn to form NMC composites, their chemical and structural
stabilities are intermediate to those of their cobalt and manga-
nese analogues. They are less prone to phase change and are
unlikely to decompose during oxidation (delithiation), due to the
Ni3+/4+ redox couple (which carries out the bulk of the redox work)
sitting at a lower potential than that of Co3+/4+ (and, crucially, the
O2 p band). However, high nickel content electrode materials
can be prone to Li+–Ni2+ site exchange.49 Furthermore, Ni4+ will
react when in contact with the electrolyte, leading to dissolved
nickel ions and electrolyte oxidation products.52
High degrees of delithiation (LixMO2 with x o 0.3), corres-
ponding to high cell SoCs, cause NMC structures, especially
Ni-rich positive electrodes such as NMC811, to become thermo-
dynamically unstable.53 High enough voltages can also lead to
decomposition, due to oxidation of lattice oxygen.
Chemical and structural decomposition are both most likely
to occur at the electrode surface. This is due to increased
surface reactivity and the higher potentials experienced at the
particle surface.53 To mitigate degradation, protective surface
films or coatings are used in some batteries to protect the PE
from attack by the electrolyte.54
High temperatures will accelerate the rate of degradation for
all the mechanisms listed above.
Electrolytes tend to be non-aqueous organics and therefore
highly reactive with water. Replacing these with non-organic
analogues is an active area of research,55 as a route to mitigating
acid dissolution of the active material.
Consequences. Degradation due to any of these mechanisms
results in the same outcomes: LAM and an increase in cell
impedance. The formation of spinel and rock salt phases near
the electrode surface not only reduces the amount of active
material available for redox cycling, it can also increase cell
impedance due to the retarded kinetics through these phases.
Reactive lattice oxygen ([O]) released during electrode
decomposition or phase change converts into oxygen gas (O2)
or forms reactive peroxide species. The amount of O2 released
is largest in the first cycle and decreases in subsequent cycles,
assumed to happen because O2 releases from the surface-near
regions only.45,56 The released [O] also oxidise ethylene carbonate
(EC) to produce gases like CO2 and CO by the following reaction:
(CH2O)2CO (EC) + [O] - 2CO2 (g) + CO (g) + 2H2O
Recent studies45,57,58 show the abovementioned mechanism is
one of the possible ways of CO2 and CO production within the
cell, other than electrochemical oxidation of EC which happens
when the cell is cycled above 5.0 V.
Formation of the pSEI layer and accelerated growth of the
negative SEI layer due to TM dissolution will cause an increase
in the cell impedance.
In one study carried out in 2017,59 cell capacity loss, impedance
increase and increase of TM content in the NE are all stated to be
driven, to an extent, by the rate of TM dissolution from the PE.
Another study, published in 2018,34 details the specific eﬀects at
the PE and NE during Mn dissolution. On the PE side, the
dissolution of Mn leads to the loss of the active material and
increased impedance of the PE. However, the eﬀect on the NE
dominates.
Links to other mechanisms. TM deposits contribute to the
formation of the pSEI layer and, similar to the behaviour seen
at the NE, particle cracking on the PE can expose fresh surfaces
to electrolyte, further promoting the degradation mechanisms
listed in this section. Dissolved TM ions can migrate through
the electrolyte to the NE,60–62 forming deposits which can
catalyse the formation of thicker, layered SEI structures, greatly
increasing the NE impedance.24,48 All of these interactions are
shown schematically in Fig. 4.
Particle fracture
Principles. Particle fracture occurs in both electrodes. It is
caused by the substantial volume change of electrode materials
and the resulting stress during electrochemical operation.63 Local
particle fragmentation has been found close to the separator because
of higher local current densities causing larger stresses.64,65 Particle
fracture is a particular challenge for active materials with high
theoretical specific capacity, e.g. silicon.

Eﬀect of silicon additives. Silicon additives can greatly boost
the specific capacity (mA h g1) of electrode materials. The
specific capacity of a pure silicon electrode is over 11 times
higher than a graphite electrode,66 as seen in Table 1.
When lithium alloys with silicon, diﬀerent Si–Li compounds
form. These compounds have various unit cell volumes, with
the unit cell of some of the largest compounds being almost
four times larger than that of pure silicon with no alloyed
lithium,67 as observed in Table 2.
The dramatic increase in size induces stress in the electrode
and can lead to mechanical failure. Particle cracking is widely
observed in silicon electrodes, even with a small amount of
silicon,68 and leads to very low cycle lifetimes.66 As the electrode
delithiates and tends towards pure silicon, the volume contracts
and electronic contact between electrode particles becomes less
eﬀective, leading to increased contact and charge transfer
resistances.69 Some Li+ ions become trapped in the Si matrix,
leading to irreversible capacity loss.
Alloying silicon with other metals, as well as dispersing the
particles within a graphite matrix, has been shown to improve
cycle life, but cycle lives are still low, compared with conven-
tional electrodes. The cycle life of pure silicon is roughly
20 cycles, whereas the cycle life of Si–C composites is close
to 70.69 Form factors that inherently constrain the electrode
stack (cylindrical, prismatic) will see better performance from
silicon electrodes. The charge capacity lost due to trapping of
Li+ ions in the contracting Si matrix can be overcome by
applying pressure during delithiation.70
Exacerbating and mitigating factors. Above room temperature, at
around 45 1C, the cell generates larger thermal stress,71 accelerating
fracture. At low temperatures, at or below 0 1C, graphite becomes
more brittle and hence more susceptible to fracture.72 Particle
cracking is worse for batteries with high Si content NEs, under
deep discharge,73 high currents and with large particle sizes.74
Manufacturing processes, e.g. calendering, can lead to strain
eﬀects and particle cracking before a battery is even in use.75
The pre-existing cracks cause stress concentration at the crack
tips and accelerate particle fracture during normal battery
operations.76
Consequences. Cracks in electrode particles have a number
of consequences:
(i) Disruption to electrical contact between active particles,
conductive additives and current collector, therefore a loss in
electronic/ionic conductivity and ultimately capacity fade,64,73
as shown in Fig. 5;
(ii) Particles beyond a certain critical size experience frac-
ture, breaking into isolated islands;77
(iii) Increased rate of SEI and pSEI formation, discussed
below, in the subsection: ‘‘Links to other mechanisms’’.
All three consequences cause capacity fade. Modelling work
by Laresgoiti et al.78 predicted a direct correlation between
particle stress and rate of capacity loss, as shown in Fig. 6.
(iv) Electrode pulverisation, occurring when small cracks in
the electrode join up and some of the active material becomes
separated from the rest of the particle. This leads to a loss in
active material and hence capacity fade.

Silicon additives. (i) The large volumetric changes during
cycling caused by silicon additives will exacerbate66 the particle
fracture eﬀect observed in the graphite anode, to the extent that
it can lead to a more severe breakdown in the integrity of
the cell structure, for example delamination79 of the electrode
from the current collector (which rarely happens in unalloyed
graphite anodes).
(ii) Formation of solid electrolyte films – unlike the formation of
a stable SEI film in graphite, the SEI formation on alloy NEs appears
to be a dynamic process of breaking off and reforming, also caused
by the large volume changes of the alloy particles during cycling.66
This is illustrated in Fig. 7.
Links to other mechanisms. Cracks in electrode particles
expose new electron-conductive surfaces to liquid electrolytes
for side reactions and trapping otherwise cyclable Li33 within
the extended SEI layer, as illustrated in Fig. 8. SEI layers, having
diﬀerent Young’s moduli and fracture toughness than the active
electrode materials, are likely to be more prone to cracking and
the SEI shell may crack on its own, without the particle
cracking.81 NEs with high Si content are subject to more extreme
volume changes during cycling and are thus more prone to
particle cracking and the associated extended SEI growth.82
Coupling between mechanisms
Whilst extensive work has been done, with many studies
describing each of these degradation mechanisms individually,
the strong coupling, promotional or suppressive, between them
is often neglected. Here we summarise some of the positive and
negative feedback loops which have been identified. The
mechanisms and their interplay are summarised in the flow-
chart in Fig. 9.
Positive feedback. SEI layer growth is often quoted as one of
the main degradation modes. Various models have been formulated
since the seminal works by Peled83 and Peled and Menkin’s84 more
recent summary of the state-of-the-art, however, many of these
models consider the SEI layer growth in isolation of other eﬀects
which can accelerate its growth. Mechanical fracture during cycling
can release new surface area for SEI layer growth, which is often
neglected, and TM dissolution from the cathode has been found to
accelerate the rate of SEI layer growth.85
Other degradation mechanisms are also vulnerable to positive
feedback. TM dissolution and TM migration into the lithium
layers of the layered oxide cathode can lead to a reduced lithium
diﬀusivity. This can therefore lead to more severe concentration
gradients and more mechanical fracture.
Mechanical fracture can also be self-reinforcing. Island for-
mation causes the interfacial surface area of the island to become
inactive, increasing the interfacial current density through the
remaining active interfacial area. Increased current density results
in increased concentration gradients, which in turn result in
increased mechanical stress and further fracture.13
Lithium plating is highly sensitive to local electrolyte potential.
SEI growth and TM deposition both cause pore blockage,
decreasing the eﬀective electrolyte conductivity and resulting
in high electrolyte potentials close to the NE-separator interface,
leading to lithium plating. Li plating also contributes to pore
blockage, making it self-reinforcing.20
Beyond pure mechanistic interactions, it is also important to
consider the sensitivity of these mechanisms to scale, with
eﬀects such as thermal gradients having detrimental impacts
on lifetime.86 In this case, uneven temperature distribution,
commonly found in commercial cells, can lead to heterogeneous
current distributions amplifying these current and temperature
sensitive degradation modes.38–41
A reduction in the lithium content from the NE will lead to
the SoC of that electrode decreasing whilst the PE remains the
same. This is known as stoichiometric drift and leads to a

reduction in the capacity but also an increase in the PE
potential at the end of charge, accelerating the PE degradation
mechanisms.
Negative feedback. Many of the conclusions made in the
literature are generalisations and, in specific cases, opposing
trends can also be proposed. For instance, the SEI layer growth
causes LLI, which increases the NE potential with respect to
Li,13 limiting the chance of lithium plating. SEI layer growth is
evidently a key mechanism to consider, with many diﬀerent
models describing the nature of the cell degradation proposed.
For instance, kinetically dominated models generally show a
linear trend in cell capacity fade over time, however many
researchers have shown that diﬀusion dominated models are
a better representation of the behaviour of thicker SEI layers,
indicating that as the SEI grows it presents greater resistance to
solvent molecules diﬀusing to the surface of the graphite, thus
limiting its own growth rate. However, this neglects the fresh
surfaces exposed by cracks during battery cycling and the
reality is likely to be a combination of kinetic and diﬀusion
dominated behaviour.
Identifying and characterising
degradation mechanisms
Whilst models are extremely useful for predicting future perfor-
mance, their parameterisation and validation are equally essential.
In much of the literature, electrochemical measurements form the
foundations of characterisation, with galvanostatic methods being
a key tool for establishing measurements of capacity, resistance
and coulombic eﬃciency. Whilst relatively simple, these measure-
ments can provide significant insight. A notable example is that of
Harlow et al.87 who extensively used high precision coulometry
(HPC) and incremental capacity analysis (ICA) to probe the
influences of diﬀerent electrolytes of a NMC532-graphite cell
towards an industrial benchmark.
Many variations of galvanostatic and potentiostatic methods
exist, each providing diﬀerent key insights. Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS), for instance, is a core technique
for decoupling resistance contributions in battery electrodes. Other
electrochemical techniques involving the OCV of the cell, such as
analysing the curve itself,14 diﬀerential voltage analysis (DVA)68 and
ICA,88 have been used to predict electrode capacities and their oﬀset
and, from this, the degradation modes of LAM and LLI. Slippage
tracking is the process of monitoring the changing positions of IC or
DV peaks as the battery is cycled, however this could be influenced
by a range of degradation mechanisms.
Beyond electrical stimuli, a range of diﬀraction, spectro-
scopy and microscopy techniques have all been used to assess
changes in electrode materials. For example, ex situ electron
imaging or X-ray imaging is straightforward and hence carried
out frequently, providing important parameters for models.64
The highly coupled nature of many of these degradation
eﬀects, and their multiscale and multi-physical interactions,

necessitates the use of multiple techniques to gain full insights
into the underpinning processes. Furthermore, there is a need
to both separate out the diﬀerent contributions and capture their
interactions. This is particularly important to consider in ex situ
coin cell experiments, where a surrogate electrolyte is used. Since
electrolyte volume and additives can have a significant impact on
lifetime, as well as introduce cross talk between the negative and
positive electrodes, this can lead to false conclusions due to
experimental artefacts. In situ measurements can be used to
overcome these challenges, however these often require modifica-
tions to the cell, which themselves bring about changes in the cell
behaviour.
Validation of models should always include the use of real
world drive cycles, to ensure that the interconnections between
models as well as path dependence are fully represented.
The focus of this part of the perspective, however, is not to
exhaustively review these techniques, but instead highlight
the insights they provide in the context of developing more
accurate battery models.
SEI layer growth
Experimental triggers. SEI grows more rapidly at high tem-
peratures and high currents, but it grows even when the cell is
at rest at high SoC, albeit at slower rates (this contributes to
calendar ageing). Since particle cracking also enhances SEI
growth, any conditions that cause particle cracking also cause
increased SEI growth.
Characterisation. In situ experiments:
(i) HPC to identify irreversible capacity loss (most likely due
to SEI growth).
(ii) EIS to monitor the impedance changes attributable to
SEI growth.
(iii) Hybrid Pulse Power Characterisation (HPPC) tests, in
lieu of EIS, are also possible.
Liu et al.28 used an electrochemical quartz crystal micro-
balance (EQCM) to monitor how the mass of the SEI increased
during formation. They confirmed these findings using in situ
diﬀerential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and
ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). They also found that
(LiOCO2CH2)2 could be re-oxidised to form Li2O.
The mechanical properties (Young’s moduli and fracture
toughness) of the SEI layer would be useful properties, however,
it is very challenging to measure these and, to our knowledge,
no experimental study has been reported to have attempted this.
Lithium plating
Experimental triggers. The main experimental trigger for
lithium plating is fast charging at low temperatures. The lower
the temperature, the more Li is plated.35 Higher charge currents
and voltages also result in more Li plating.89
Characterisation. Three diﬀerent in situ methods for quantify-
ing Li plating using cyclic capacity fade are proposed:89
(i) Resistance–capacity plot – assuming that Li plating does
not increase the cell’s resistance, capacity loss due to plating is
equal to the difference in capacity between the cell with plating
and the cell without, for the same value of resistance.
(ii) Arrhenius plots – non-Arrhenius behaviour results from
Li plating, while Arrhenius behaviour results from SEI growth.
Capacity loss due to Li plating is found by extrapolating
the Arrhenius behaviour from higher temperatures and sub-
tracting extrapolated and measured capacity losses at the lower
temperatures.
(iii) Conditions which trigger plating result in anomalously
high capacity fade rates per cycle. Zhang et al.89 assume that
any capacity fade 40.024% per cycle is due to plating, but the
exact value will vary between diﬀerent cell types.
One proposed in situ method of quantifying plating resulting
from a single charge is to detect the inverse stripping reaction
through a tell-tale minimum in diﬀerential voltage (dV/dQ)
plots,37 but the large spread of values in the literature call the
reliability of this method into question.38,90 ICA (dQ/dV) has also
been shown to have an additional minimum at high voltages
when stripping occurs.91
Any of these methods can be used to parameterise a Li plating
model, by adjusting the rate constant for the side reaction so that
the model predicts the correct amount of Li to be plated.
Positive electrode structural change and decomposition
Experimental triggers. All six of the degradation mechanisms
covered in the previous section on PE structural change and
decomposition will be exacerbated at elevated temperatures.58,92
With the exception of oxidation of the lattice oxygen, none of
the mechanisms listed (phase change, cation site exchange,
chemical oxidation of the electrolyte, acid attack, and pSEI for-
mation) are direct electrochemical processes and so are not directly
aﬀected by varying the cell voltage or current. However, they are
indirectly linked through the potential of the electrode (degree of
lithiation) and the dynamics of the electrode–electrolyte interface,
which are themselves functions of electrode potential and current.58
Oxidation of lattice oxygen is an electrochemical process,
happening when the electrode potential is greater than the
edge of the O2 p band.44 Due to the oxidation potentials of the
TM redox couples generally being below this value, oxidation of
lattice oxygen will only happen in the extremely high SoC range.
Phase change from layered to spinel or rock salt structures is
more favourable at low degrees of lithiation (high SoC), corres-
ponding to high cell voltages. Higher ambient temperature
favours the phase transformation from the layered NMC structure
to the rock salt layer. The bulk materials undergo a two-phase
transition from their layered structure to a spinel structure and
eventually to a rock salt structure at around B170 1C.92–94 For-
mation of more spinel/rock salt layer leads to [O] evolution, LAM
and impedance rise.
Chemical oxidation of the electrolyte is primarily due to the
presence of highly oxidised TM species (Ni4+), which also
corresponds to high SoCs (and therefore high voltages).51 Due
to this reaction taking place at the electrode–electrolyte inter-
face, any conditions which lead to exposure of new electrode
surfaces (e.g. particle cracking) will exacerbate this mechanism.
Acid attack is due to the presence of contaminants in the
electrolyte and can thus occur across the SoC range of the cell
(full voltage range). Experimental studies45,46,57,58 have found

that high temperature and high voltage conditions should
encourage TM dissolution and eventually encourage pSEI
formation. This is likely due to the high voltage at higher SoCs
(60–100%) exposing fresh electrode surfaces to the electrolyte.
The result is spinel/rock salt phase transformation and O2
evolution, with subsequent TM dissolution.59
Characterisation. The eﬀects of capacity fade and impe-
dance increase should be visible through standard battery test
methods. LAM at the PE will change the OCV profile of the
battery, with peak depression, shift, or broadening in ICA an
obvious sign. Direct in situ measurement of the mechanisms
behind this performance drop are significantly more diﬃcult,
however, and often require specially instrumented cells.45
The eﬀects of these degradation mechanisms should be
observable upon cell disassembly using structural and chemical
analyses of the electrodes and electrolyte.56 The electrode structure
can be examined using techniques such as X-ray diﬀraction and
spectroscopy (XRD and XAS), and electron microscopy and spectro-
scopy (TEM, SEM, EDX and EELS), giving information about the
structural change of the electrode, any defects (e.g. Ni2+/Li+ site
exchange) and surface films.53 The chemical composition of the
electrode could also be analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectro-
scopy (XPS), atomic emission spectroscopy (such as ICP-OES), or
gas chromatography (GC).50,95 This would also reveal if TMs have
deposited onto the NE and the composition of surface films.96
The presence of a spinel/rock salt phase at the PE particle
surface and the O2 evolution from the PE have been confirmed
with the help of the following experiments:
(i) Reconstructed disordered layer upon phase transforma-
tion was visualised using the atomic resolution ADF-STEM
imaging, as shown in Fig. 10.
(ii) Online Electrochemical Mass Spectrometry (OEMS) has
shown that at higher degrees of delithiation, all three NMC
formulations (NMC111, NMC622 and NMC811) release O2 at
room temperature (25 1C) which eventually reacts with EC to
produce CO and CO2, as shown in Fig. 11.45
(iii) Phase changes in the NMC materials can be tracked by
plotting ICA peaks at higher voltages (3.0–4.8 V)45 and standard
electrochemical characterisations at similar conditions can
capture the capacity fade and impedance rise in the cell
happening because of this particular degradation mechanism.
The thicknesses of both the spinel/rock salt phase and pSEI
at diﬀerent operating conditions reported in several publications are
as follows:
(a) 15–100 nm spinel/rock salt layer thickness has been
reported for different battery chemistries at different cycling,
operating and storage conditions.53,97,98
(b) Comparing gas chromatographs of fresh and calendar
aged electrodes, stored for a year under ambient conditions, a
surface layer (pSEI) of up to B10 nm thickness was found on
the NMC811 positive electrodes.50
Additionally, the electrolyte can be analysed for the presence
of TM ions and any electrolyte degradation products using
NMR, ICP-OES, UV/vis-spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry.95
Particle fracture
Experimental triggers. Operating at extreme temperatures,
both above room temperature and sub-zero temperatures, acceler-
ates electrode particle fracture. High current loading causes a larger
concentration gradient, resulting in greater stress and a higher
likelihood of fracture. Cycling across certain SoC windows, for
example during graphite staging,72 can also accelerate fracture. From
the material’s perspective, electrodes with high silicon content
and/or large electrode particle size exhibit greater degrees of fracture.
Silicon additives. Generally, diﬀerent degrees of lithiation of
the NE will cause diﬀerent phases of Li–Si products to be
formed, with the highest lithiated phase having a volume of
400% of a delithiated silicon lattice.69 From the literature, there
does not seem to be a ‘‘standard’’ SoC window that this occurs

in; this will depend on the ratio of silicon in the electrode. Yao
et al. carried out an in operando experiment on cycling behaviour
of silicon–graphite blended electrodes, and the results revealed
that the lithiation of silicon occurs throughout the whole range
of voltage, while the lithiation of graphite starts when the
potential dips below 0.2 V. The delithiation is carried out
sequentially: Li extraction happens first from graphite particles
and then from silicon particles, when the voltage exceeds 0.22 V.
These experimental facts indicate that in a graphite anode
composited with silicon, the large volume change of silicon
should occur during more than one voltage (SoC) range.99
Zhang66 briefly mentions the eﬀects of temperature on cycle
life in silicon/matrix negative electrodes. The findings are that
higher temperatures increased the capacity of the cells per
cycle, but were detrimental to the cycle life of the cell. This
could be attributed to the reduction in overpotential for cells at
a higher temperature, allowing more of the lithium to be
removed from the silicon in normal operating voltage windows,
causing smaller particle size and hence increased tensile
stresses in the electrode.
There seems to be no concrete evidence of the eﬀects of
C-rate on cycle life in electrodes with silicon additives.
Characterisation. In situ measurements include use of an
acoustic emissions sensor,100 where fractures return a characteristic
waveform and in situ X-ray computed tomography (XCT) in snap-
shot mode, shown in Fig. 12.63 These measurements validate the
operating conditions at which fracture occurs, predicted by
simulations. To determine the extent of particle cracking, studies
use in situ and ex situ XRD to image the electrodes.64,66,69 XCT
information provides important parameters for models, including
crack length, fragment particle size and particle volume changes.
Fig. 13 shows an example of ex situ SEM, showing fracture of a
Si–graphite anode.68
Stress/strain measurements on stack level101 are highly
relevant to failure analysis due to particle fracture, though they
do not provide direct evidence of fracture. The stress/strain
values are important parameters for fatigue models.
DVA (dV/dQ) is used to determine the LAM in the electrodes,
which can be an indicator of particle fracture, the work of Li
et al. being an example.68 However, other mechanisms can lead
to LAM too and some fractures may not be severe enough to
cause LAM.
For particle fracture, the important parameters are (1) stress/
strain and (2) intrinsic mechanical properties of the materials.
In situ stress/strain measurement can be done by digital image
correlations, curvature measurement methods and optical fibre
sensor.102 Material properties including Young’s modulus,
hardness and fracture strength can be measured by indentation
tests.103
As a guide to designing experiments for investigating specific
battery degradation mechanisms in isolation, where possible, or
in concert, where required, Table 3 shows the experimental
conditions which can be expected to trigger the primary and
secondary degradation mechanisms covered in this perspective.
Models of battery degradation
The performance and behaviour of a battery depends on the
integrity of its complex inner structure. At present, it is diﬃcult
to directly measure State of Health (SoH) of a battery, as sensors
placed within the structure are expensive and could disrupt the
function. Instead, battery models which accurately predict their
long-term behaviour can act as a ‘‘digital twin’’ of the battery,
running alongside it as it operates and ages and occasionally
resynchronising, using input from the few measurements which
can be obtained, such as cell voltage, temperature and current.
The SoC of a battery, essential information for smart charging,
is also diﬃcult to measure and must be estimated by the digital
twin. For both SoC and SoH monitoring, simulations need to be
both accurate and very fast, providing results in real time.
By predicting the key performance parameters of a battery,
such as capacity and lifetime, models can also be useful tools

for designing electrodes, cells and packs, enabling the vast
design space of batteries to be explored, where the constituent
materials, electrode structure, thermal management and many
more aspects can be varied and combined, without the need for
expensive and potentially hazardous prototypes to be built.
Types of models
In general, there are essentially two approaches for modelling:
empirical and physics-based. The former involves an incremental
process of applying equations and parameters to achieve the best
fit to experimental data, while the latter derives the simulated
behaviour from equations known to represent the actual physical
behaviour involved. In empirical models, the underlying equa-
tions may not have any real meaning, but rather attempt to
emulate the behaviour of the battery, which is treated as a black box.
There are also hybrid models employing simplifying techniques to
achieve the speed of empirical models while harnessing the accuracy
of a physics-based approach. Examples include the single particle
model105 and mechanistic models,25 which use an inverse approach
to estimate cell voltage and capacity for a given degradation
mechanism and are becoming more widely used for machine
learning (ML) and BMS.36 Fig. 14 shows the various scales
involved in physical and empirical models.
Empirical. One family of empirical models is equivalent-
circuit models (ECM), describing the electrical behaviour of a
battery using a set of circuit elements, such as resistors and
capacitors. The elements in the model may not necessarily have
direct relevance to the real device, but simulate its overall
behaviour. Due to its computational eﬃciency in terms of
speed, memory and numerical convergence, ECMs are widely
used in BMS to predict the SoC and SoH of batteries for vehicle
power management control.88,107,108 In principle, this technique
predicts the battery voltages based on current inputs, where
diﬀerent resistor–capacitor combinations are used to represent
different time constants inherent in a battery.109 Commonly
studied equivalent-circuit models include The´venin model, the
Randles model and resistance–capacitance (RC) network based
ECMs, such as first-order RC, second-order RC and third-order
RC models.108,110 Because the ECM is an empirical model, it is
often limited by the underlying experimental data and cannot
provide deep insights into the electrochemical interactions
within the battery. A model developed for a particular scenario
may therefore not be applicable to another. For example,
empirical battery degradation models for EVs often assume a regular
daily charging pattern. Obtaining an accurate empirical model of
battery degradation therefore requires that operation-specific battery
ageing experiments be performed for each new application. Such
tests take months or even years and would have to be performed in
advance, using expensive test facilities. Moreover, fitting an ECM to
experimental datasets can be ambiguous, as different arrangements
of the circuit elements can be fitted to obtain a similar impedance
curve.111 Therefore, proper assignment of the circuit elements can
only be achieved when adequate information on the underlying
electrochemical phenomena is available.
Physical. In contrast to empirical models, physics-based
models use a set of coupled partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs),
based on vector calculus and physical chemistry, to model the
electrochemical and chemical interactions within a battery. The
physics can be described at a range of scales, shown in Fig. 14,
from the atomistic/molecular scale of materials, through to
microscale structure of electrodes and continuum scale models
representing whole cells. The values derived at each scale can
provide input parameters for the models at higher scales. Typi-
cally, these models describe the charge and mass conservations
in the homogeneous solid and electrolyte, as well as the lithium
flux between the solid and electrolyte phases. Digital simulation
of the physics-based models requires a discretisation in space
and time. Three frequently used discretisation methods include
(1) finite diﬀerence, where space and time are divided into small
segments, and the derivatives are discretised using Euler’s rule;
(2) finite volume, in which time is divided into small segments
and space into volumes; and (3) finite element, where time is

divided into small segments but space is formulated as a
summation over quadratic or linear basis function.106
At the atomistic scale, no universal framework exists for
simulating degradation mechanisms, but classical molecular
dynamics (MD), mesoscopic modelling and ab initio density
functional theory (DFT) have been used to investigate the origin
and eﬀects of cracking and stresses in Si anodes during
charge112 and techniques for understanding cathode degradation
have been recently reviewed.113
Doyle, Fuller and Newman have developed the widely used
electrochemical model including mass conservation, charge
conservation and reaction kinetics.114,115 As the model consists
of a spatial variation along the thickness of the electrode and a
pseudo radial dimension along the solid phase electrode particles,
these models are commonly known as pseudo-two-dimensional
(P2D) models. While this model can provide a comprehensive
analysis of the internal dynamics of a battery,114,115 discretising
and solving a physics-based model in both dimensions often result
in hundreds or even thousands of equations. Therefore, imple-
menting a physics-based model for real-time BMS monitoring
is computationally expensive.
Single-particle models (SPM). To bridge the gap between
empirical and physics-based models, the SPM was developed,
in which each electrode domain is simplified into a single
spherical particle.116–118 Unlike an electrochemical model, it is
assumed that radial diffusion of lithium-ions in the electrode
particle is the slowest process and, therefore, lithium concentration
gradients in the particle occur only in the radial direction.118 Despite
the reduced computational demand compared to a physics-based
electrochemical model, one significant drawback of the SPM is that
the model does not consider Li-ion distribution in the electro-
lyte phase. As a rule, SPMs are usually limited to low-current
applications, which constrain the usage of such models for fast-
charging in an electric vehicle.119,120 Kemper and Kum showed
that this limitation can be mitigated by extending the SPM to
include the electrolyte dynamics, which could improve the
prediction accuracy by 14%, compared with the standard
SPM.120 Recently, Li and co-workers121 have also extended a
SPM with electrolyte dynamics to include SEI layer formation, in
which crack propagation due to stress generated by the volume
expansion of the particles are coupled to predict the effects of
chemical and mechanical degradation. They showed that the
effect of crack propagation depends strongly on temperature,
current densities and particle sizes. By including the SEI layer
formation and crack propagation, they were able to accurately
predict battery capacity fade and voltage profile as a function of
cycle number over a broad temperature range with an error
of 10.3  103 root-mean-square error (RMSE), compared to
experimental results.
SEI layer growth
Many P2D models of SEI growth exist, all of which are pre-
dominantly based on the pioneering work of Safari et al.,29 who
model solvent diﬀusion through the SEI layer, followed by electro-
chemical reactions governed by the Tafel equation, including
both kinetic and diﬀusion limitations. Although the degradation
mechanism of SEI is well captured by these physics-based models,
their high computation cost is prohibitive for simulating degrada-
tion over hundreds or thousands of cycles. For this, semi-empirical
and empirical models are preferred, where the fitted ageing laws
capture resistance increase and capacity loss caused by SEI
degradation. These ageing laws can be implemented on both
physics-based and ECMs.
In a semi-empirical degradation model by Zhang et al.,122
SEI layer growth is expected to be the main cause of battery
degradation at temperatures between 25 and 30 1C. Key para-
meters such as OCV, resistance, diﬀusion coeﬃcient and electro-
chemical reaction rates, were extracted from cycling degradation
tests. With these fundamental parameters expressed as a function
of cycle number, cyclical ageing could be simulated by the P2D
model, while the ageing simulation based on the original
physics-based degradation model of Safari et al.29 is unrealistic.
The empirical model is frequently combined with ECMs,
due to their simplicity and ability to lump all the degradation
physics into limited variables. In a study by Liaw et al.,123 based
on lumped ECM, empirical ageing laws of resistance and capacity
loss, as a result of SEI degradation, are described. Cordoba-Arenas
et al.124 takes into account factors of SoC swing, current and
temperature. The simplicity and proven accuracy of these models
makes them suitable for battery SoH estimation. Moreover, due to
the fact that the SoH Kalman filter algorithm is mostly based on
equivalent circuits, SoH prediction can easily be combined with the
empirical type degradation model.125 The work of Fleckenstein
et al.126 introduces an SEI degradation distributed model by imple-
menting empirical ageing laws into an electrothermal model of a
large format cell. The SEI degradation inhomogeneity is represented
by the distribution of impedance and capacity loss.
Above all, the physics-based model of SEI layer growth can
capture the degradation behaviours with clear physical mean-
ings. Based on the P2D model framework, the SEI degradation
mode can be linked with other degradation mechanisms and
there have been attempts to model the stress and fatigue behaviour
with both the SEI and the electrode materials combined, where SEI
properties were assumed.78
Lithium plating
Li plating and the inverse process, Li stripping, can be incor-
porated into P2D models by adding an additional Butler–
Volmer equation for the side reaction, as first proposed by
Arora, Doyle and White in 1999.127
The most mathematically rigorous model in the literature is that
of Yang et al.,37 illustrated in Fig. 15, as they explicitly consider
dependence on both electrolyte and plated Li concentrations.
O’Kane et al.90 build on Yang’s model by incorporating a
nonlinear diﬀusion model that accounts for phase transitions
in the graphite NE. They show that nonlinear diﬀusion yields
qualitatively diﬀerent results.
Positive electrode structural change and decomposition
PE degradation is an ongoing area of research, with several publica-
tions available on the diﬀerent mechanisms of positive electrodes.
However, very few studies deal with the mechanisms individually.

(i) Phase change and oxygen evolution: oxygen evolution
from the PE has been conventionally modelled as the oxidation
of electrolyte at the PE side using a simple kinetically limited Tafel
equation.13,85,128 However, this approach does not include any
physics to describe the source of the oxygen evolution. Ghosh
et al.129 have recently proposed the first model to include this,
describing oxygen evolution from the bulk and diﬀusion through
the rock salt layer using a shrinking core model. This model can
reproduce the modes LLI and LAM, and the eﬀects of capacity fade
and power fade caused by this mechanism. Jana et al.128 proposed
that the capacity fade is a linear function of the oxidation current
density, which they used in the Tafel equation to model the
electrolyte oxidation at the PE. This oxidation reaction also
produces H2 which in turn enhances the TM dissolution.
(ii) TM dissolution and pSEI formation: TM dissolution at
the PE is modelled using a first order chemical reaction, limited by
concentration of H+ ions in the electrolyte.130 H+ ions are generated
from LiPF6 salt dissociation in the electrolyte and solvent oxidation
at the PE.130 While LiPF6 dissociation in the presence of H2O is
modelled using a chemical reaction rate, solvent oxidation is
modelled using irreversible Butler–Volmer kinetics.130 Lin et al.85
provided detailed P2D model equations for Mn dissolution at the PE
coupled with SEI layer formation at NE. The Mn deposition on the
NE is also included in the model. The growth of the pSEI can be
modelled as similar to any of the SEI layer growth models.
Particle fracture
The stress model in electrode particles has been developed as a
function of current, particle size and partial molar volume.74
The fatigue crack model (Paris’ law) has been incorporated
into a single particle model for predicting battery capacity loss.121
Crack propagation is coupled with the SEI formation and growth
(diﬀusion dominant), to account for the loss of lithium inventory.
Morphological eﬀects from electrode microstructures have
been studied by Xu et al.,64 using finite element method in 3D.
Cracks were handled by breaking the connection between two
elements using a cohesive model.
Silicon additives. While silicon reacts electrochemically with
lithium-ions to form lithium metal alloys, achieving high specific
and volumetric capacities, large volume expansion occurs due to the
alloying reactions. Otero and co-workers131 derived an analytical
model to demonstrate the importance of the volume expansion
factor and initial porosity in achieving high gravimetric and
volumetric capacities, summarised in Fig. 16. Sethuraman
et al.132 developed an electrochemical-mechanical model based
on the Larche´ and Cahn chemical potential calculation, to study
the eﬀects of electrode mechanics on the potential hysteresis.
Combined models
Fig. 17 shows the three main stages of battery degradation. The
initial acceleration stage is thought to be caused by the initial
SEI formation,13,85 which rapidly reduces the capacity but also
hinders further SEI growth. The causes of the stabilisation
(linear ageing) and saturation (nonlinear ageing) stages are
more debatable. Various models of two or more degradation
mechanisms have been published, each proposing a diﬀerent
explanation as to what causes the switch from stabilisation to
saturation stages.
The models of Arora, Doyle and White,127 Yang et al.20 and
Zhao et al.35 are notable for considering the coupling between
Li plating and SEI growth, in diﬀerent ways. Arora, Doyle and
White127 assume that a fraction of the plated Li immediately
reacts to form SEI instead of forming Li metal, but the simpli-
city of their model means this SEI can be stripped, as if it was
plated Li. Yang et al.20 use two separate Tafel equations for the
two reactions, in order to model a scenario where SEI-induced
pore clogging causes rapid Li plating even at room temperature,
causing the transition between the stabilisation and saturation

stages of degradation. Zhao et al.35 present an updated version
of Arora, Doyle and White’s model that allows them to model
both reversible and irreversible plating at the same time.
Few attempts have been made to model more than two
degradation mechanisms at a time. Lin et al.85 presented a
combined model of Mn dissolution, SEI formation and Mn
deposition on the NE and analysed the combined eﬀect of these
degradation mechanisms. The model was able to qualitatively
reproduce all three stages of degradation, but neither quantitative
comparison with experiment nor temperature variation were
included. A recent follow-up paper by Li, Landers and Park133 added
a semi-empirical model of SEI formation on cracks in particles and
found that the majority of SEI was formed on cracks, as opposed to
growing on top of existing SEI.
Jin et al.134 combined Safari et al.’s29 model of SEI growth on
the NE, the same model applied to pSEI growth on the PE and
an empirical model for loss of electrical contact due to particle
cracking in both electrodes. The experiments did not last long
enough to include the saturation stage, but the physics-based
degradation model was found to be far superior to both equivalent
circuit and purely empirical models in predicting capacity loss
during an EV drive cycle.
Reniers, Mulder and Howey13 devised a SPM incorporating a
NE SEI model valid in both the reaction-limited and diﬀusion-
limited extremes, a Tafel equation for irreversible lithium
plating on the NE, an empirical expression for loss of electrical
contact in the NE and a Tafel equation for acid dissolution of the
PE. Their model results in a good qualitative fit to experimental
data at 25 1C and 45 1C, but not at 5 1C, which implies their
model of lithium plating could be improved.
Keil and Jossen135 presented a P2D model combining SEI growth,
SEI formation on cracks and partially reversible Li plating. Like Yang
et al.,20 they found that Li plating could explain the transition from
linear to nonlinear ageing, even at room temperature.
From these combined models, three diﬀerent possible explana-
tions for the transition between stabilisation and saturation stages
emerge. Lin et al.’s 201385 model predicts that the stabilisation
stage is dominated by SEI growth on the NE while the saturation
stage is dominated by acid dissolution of the PE. Yang et al.20
propose that the transition is caused by SEI-induced pore clogging,
which in turn causes Li plating, neglecting the role of the PE
completely. Keil and Jossen135 also found that partially reversible
Li plating could explain the transition. Reniers, Mulder and
Howey13 argue that their empirical model of electrical contact loss
also reproduces the saturation stage.
Prospective applications of machine learning
In recent years, ML techniques have become increasingly deployed
at multiple length scales to aid researchers handle the increasing
volumes of data and develop new underpinning insights. At the
microstructural level, Wei et al.136 demonstrated a supervised and
unsupervised data mining approach to analyse larger XCT
datasets for studying the eﬀect of heterogeneous electrode
particle degradation on cell level performance. Jiang et al.137
also used ML approaches to aid their tomographic analysis of
interfacial degradation eﬀects between electrode particles and
binders/conductive additives which are generally diﬃcult to
segment. Here, a convolutional neural network approach was
used to aid with image segmentation. However, the real power
of ML approaches come from not just automating analysis, but
from developing deeper insights. Gayon-Lombardo et al.,138 for
instance, developed a deep convolutional generative adversarial
network for the creation of synthetic microstructures. The
power of these approaches further manifest themselves as these
insights are integrated within a multiscale framework from
atomistic length scales towards cell level control with the fusion
of models, data and ML.139,140
At the cell level, various authors have demonstrated the
ability to provide accurate estimations of the remaining useful
lifetime (RUL) by using techniques such as linear regression141
and diﬀerent types of neural networks from input voltage
and resistance data. Often these signals are transformed into
diﬀerentials, with Severson et al.142 showing that diﬀerential
capacity is a strong indicator of RUL. Extensions of these
approaches which use spectroscopic information, such as EIS,
have also demonstrated accurate RUL estimation from non-
intuitive data sources. Zhang et al.143 for instance combined
EIS measurements of batteries aged in various modes with
Gaussian process regression and an automatic feature identifi-
cation approach to identify two specific frequencies (2 Hz and
17 Hz) which were particularly sensitive to degradation. Here
the authors attribute this to changing interfacial properties,
however further validation of this was needed.
Beyond these applications, text mining tools have also been
developed, such as the work by Torayev et al.144 which auto-
matically scanned over 1800 articles and extracted key perfor-
mance data for a LiO2 system. Predicting battery catastrophic
failure is also an emerging domain of interest for data-driven
approaches as highlighted by Finegan et al.145 However, whilst
the frameworks are currently available, ensuring large enough
volumes of high quality data and the fusion of multi-modal
data types remains a challenge.
Conclusions
Understanding battery degradation is vital for developing high
performance batteries that will meet the requirements for
multiple applications. This perspective has identified five principal
degradation mechanisms that are most commonly considered to
be the cause of battery degradation during normal operation.
These are SEI layer growth, lithium plating, PE decomposition
and particle fracture at both electrodes. These five principal
degradation mechanisms interact with each other and give rise
to thirteen secondary degradation mechanisms, which are shown in
Fig. 9, along with their interconnections. All of these degradation
mechanisms result in 5 modes which are observable at the cell level.
These are: LLI inventory, impedance change, stoichiometric drift,
and LAM at both electrodes. These then result in operational eﬀects
such as capacity or power fade. Calendar or cycle ageing merely
represent diﬀerent pathways through the degradation space repre-
sented by these mechanisms.

Multiple interactions between degradation mechanisms
have been identified and discussed, which in many cases require
further study to properly understand. Multiple explanations to
explain the transition between linear and non-linear degradation
were found, also known as the knee point, cell drop-oﬀ, sudden
failure, etc. Two examples of coupling found to explain this
include SEI layer growth leading to pore blockage and subse-
quent lithium plating, and SEI layer growth leading to electrolyte
loss and the cell drying out. However, we found no evidence for a
universal explanation that applies in every case. We consider it to
be far more likely that all reported explanations are possible, as
well as many not proposed yet, and that the exact combination of
degradation mechanisms that leads to end-of-life will be a
function of cell chemistry and how a cell is used, simply resulting
again in diﬀerent pathways through the degradation space.
Multiple other degradation mechanisms were considered, but
were not included in this perspective, as they were not generally
considered to be significant during normal operation.
Battery models need to be parameterised before they can be
reliably applied to particular chemistries, applications or stages
of the battery life. A variety of experimental and atomistic
techniques exist for battery parameterisation, but these are
not well understood and there is a need for a similar, concerted
eﬀort to be made to review parameterisation techniques for
battery models.
We found that degradation at the PE is generally overlooked
and the majority of previous work has been focused on the
negative electrode. However, with the increased use of high nickel
NMC electrodes, the thermodynamic stability of the electrode is
lowered and positive electrode degradation is increasingly reported
as significant.
The conditions that promote or attenuate the progression of
each degradation mechanism are summarised, in a way that
will help inform how to operate a cell to extend life, and also
inform the design of accelerated degradation experiments.
Understanding that only degradation modes and not the
mechanisms themselves are observable at the cell level in situ,
and which degradation mechanisms result in similar modes,
will also help with the design of accelerated degradation experi-
ments for which the eﬀects of each degradation mechanism on
its own are observable. The attempts to model each degradation
mechanism and a limited number of examples of attempts to
couple degradation mechanisms are also summarised, in a way
that will help inform future modelling attempts.
We propose that the first universal cell degradation model
that would be suitable for the majority of operating conditions
would need to include the 5 principal and 13 secondary
degradation mechanisms that we have identified and how they
interact with each other. However, consensus has not yet been
reached for the governing equations for many of these mechanisms
and parameterisation will be diﬃcult, requiring modellers and
experimentalists to work closely together. However, achieving this
‘moonshot’ goal would significantly advance the field of lithium ion
battery modelling and would provide industry with an extremely
useful tool to extend battery lifetime and performance in multiple
applications.
