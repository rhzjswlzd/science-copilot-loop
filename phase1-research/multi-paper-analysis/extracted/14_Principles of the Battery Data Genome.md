SUMMARY
Batteries are central to modern society. They are no longer just a
convenience but a critical enabler of the transition to a resilient,
low-carbon
economy.
Battery
development
capabilities
are
provided by communities spanning materials discovery, battery
chemistry and electrochemistry, cell and pack design, scale-up,
manufacturing, and deployments. Despite their relative maturity,
data-science practices among these diverse groups are far behind
the state of the art in other ﬁelds, which have demonstrated an abil-
ity to signiﬁcantly improve innovation and economic impact. The
negative consequences of the present paradigm include incremen-
tal improvements but few breakthroughs, signiﬁcant manufacturing
uncertainties, and cascading investment risks that collectively slow
deployments. The primary roadblock to a battery-data-science re-
naissance is the requirement for large amounts of high-quality
data, which are not available in the current fragmented ecosystem.
Here, we identify gaps and propose principles that enable the solu-
tion by building a robust community of data hubs with standardized
practices and ﬂexible sharing options that will seed advanced tools
spanning innovation to deployment. Precedents are offered that
demonstrate that both public good and immense economic gains
will arise from sharing valuable battery data. The proposed Battery
Data Genome looks to broadly transform innovations and revolu-
tionize their translation from research to societal impact.
INTRODUCTION
Batteries are a cornerstone of decarbonization; they enable electriﬁed transporta-
tion and signiﬁcant renewable energy generation on the electrical grid.1,2 Their
impact continues to expand rapidly as performance steadily improves, costs contin-
uously decline, and deployments accelerate.3,4 The Nobel Committee acknowl-
edged the importance of batteries by awarding the 2019 Chemistry Prize for the
development of lithium-ion batteries which ‘‘laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil
fuel-free society.’’5 Batteries are an international enterprise with many countries
innovating across the global battery value chain. For example, the US Department
of Energy’s Energy Storage Grand Challenge,6 the European Union’s Battery
2030+ research initiative7 and the UK’s Faraday Battery Challenge,8 are all focused
on organizing a cohesive battery community as the catalyst for an innovative, robust
clean-energy economy that addresses urgent climate issues.
CONTEXT & SCALE
Batteries are a key enabling
technology in the transition to a
low-carbon economy but have yet
to enjoy the revolutionary data-
science gains enjoyed by other
ﬁelds. In the proposed Battery
Data Genome, we identify gaps
hindering this transformation and
put forth organizing and
operating principles that can drive
uniform practices that are the
foundation of the solution. Our
path forward builds a community
of data hubs with standardized
practices and, critically, with
ﬂexible sharing options.
Together, these will enable data-
science advances across a
reimagined international battery
community that will catalyze a new
generation of innovation with
broader economic impact. As a
call to action, the Battery Data
Genome is a crucial step to
address the global low-carbon
challenge. The authors are
committed to continue advancing
the Battery Data Genome by
expanding and linking the existing
data hubs and by building the
community and organizational
structure needed for success.

Despite pressing needs, deep commitments, and broad excitement, battery innova-
tion and investment have yet to enjoy the revolutionary data-science gains enjoyed
by other ﬁelds. Upgrading battery data and software sharing practices, which are de-
cades behind contemporary paradigms in communities such as genomics, therapeu-
tics, protein crystallography, atomistic simulations, and materials science, would
transform this important international industry.9–19 (See supplemental information
for further details.) The Human Genome Project (HGP) is one well-known example
of broad data-sciences impact: a 2011 analysis of the $3.8B US federal government
HGP investment spread over 13 years and ending in 2003, indicates that it created
$796B of direct economic impact, $244B of personal income, and 310,000 jobs in
the ﬁrst 8 years after its completion. A 2019 analysis of The Materials Genome Initia-
tive (MGI)19 concludes that it provides signiﬁcant impacts in science and technology
across diverse industries, such as medicine, catalysis, transportation, etc. These are
but a few instances in a rich history demonstrating that an open dataset with com-
mon tools can catalyze extraordinary innovations that not only seed public good
through knowledge, but also generate enormous economic gains of a magnitude
that are otherwise improbable.
In contrast, it has taken morethan30years fromthe initial commercialization ofLi-ionbat-
teries to achieve today’s energy and power density and cycle life.20,21 Productivity and
innovation gaps in today’s approach include: the sluggish pace of linking theoretical ad-
vances with experimental validation; tedious materials discovery; time-consuming per-
formance and life testing that slows validation; and an inability to fully understand and
mitigatedevicedegradation-pathways thatcompromise systemdesigns.While batteries
today are often described in idealized settings using physics-based or even empirical
models, these are often insufﬁcient when applied outside the restraints under which
they were developed. While some level of success can still be achieved with traditional
methods, recent history illustrates that these collectively lead to cascading investment
risks that slow market adoption, with negative societal and economic impact.22 Creating
more sophisticated tools, which can include aspects of both data-driven and physics-
based approaches,23 will require more data to capture the complexity of both battery
technologies and applications. Establishing coordinated battery-data-science efforts
will provide distinct economic and social impacts in an accelerated timeframe.
The primary roadblock is that modern data science requires large quantities of data,
and that no single entity can or will provide it to the battery community at the scale
needed to generate a suite of breakthrough tools that will catalyze a new innovation
paradigm. Academics, national laboratories, and small companies are often willing
to open-source data, but their databases are typically too small. Successful multina-
tional battery corporations likely have sufﬁcient data to support modern data-sci-
ence projects but will not risk their competitive edge by sharing.
While behind other communities, the battery community has a unique opportunity
to rapidly spur technology development and deployment due the current global
focus and realization of the need for batteries and a distinct interest in evolving
how battery researchers are trained. The signiﬁcance of batteries as a key compo-
nent of climate-change solutions requires an innovation transformation that can
be catalyzed with data sciences. Leveraging the alignment of climate need,
emerging workforce, and rapidly evolving tools suggests that this is the time for
the battery community to establish its own data genome.
We propose the Battery Data Genome (BDG) as a global initiative to assemble a
massive collection of battery databases. We use the genome terminology less to

link batteries to a biological genome but more to invoke the conceptual analogy of a
historically immense, complex, and urgent set of problems faced by the battery
community, which has similar lofty goals and similar urgency. This follows ap-
proaches of other earlier activities including the MGI.
As a collection of connected data hubs with uniform standards and practices and
with open software that serves needs from data collection through life and perfor-
mance analysis, the structure will enable the BDG to serve as both a data-generation
and data-harvesting asset rooted in ﬂexible sharing options to accommodate
diverse organizational and individual constraints. The BDG will include contributions
from scientiﬁcally diverse communities and span all technology readiness levels
(TRLs) from theory, experiment, piloting of both materials and devices, mature
manufacturing, and authentic ﬁeld deployments. As the BDG grows it will serve as
a key source for guiding data generation by elevating data standardization and
collection practices through the development of best practices, community
outreach and education efforts, and by establishing key challenge problems. Global
scope is a key enabler to assemble a sufﬁciently abundant database in the face of
sharing concerns. The global vision additionally acknowledges that battery contribu-
tions to climate-change solutions are international enterprises that require participa-
tion of emerging and currently underrepresented economies, despite their limited
resources. Thus, the BDG will enable global advances, especially in deployment
which is critical to achieving net zero world goals.
The magnitude of the BDG’s challenge to sharing norms is not underestimated. At the
root of the BDG are stakeholders who must balance their individual aspirations with
essential sharing requirements of this vision—individual contributors, public institutions,
private proﬁt-generating organizations, and a broad customer base. Competition for vis-
ibility, research funding, proﬁt, and market share serve as a strong deterrent to cooper-
ation. Public institutions generally align with the broad BDG goals if success metrics,
such as publications, are not compromised. Proﬁt-generating organizations will beneﬁt
from the use of open community data and software while protecting their trade secrets
and propriety information with ﬂexible sharing practices. The BDG’s design principles
and organizational structure weave the promise of transformative capabilities with ac-
commodations of individual concerns for competition. Ultimately, standardized prac-
tices and interoperable tools will enable cooperation and grow a more cohesive commu-
nity, as they have done in many other ﬁelds. We expect that, much like other ﬁelds, this
will spur additional innovation and accelerate the path from benchtop to deployment.
As detailed below, opportunities in discovery, manufacturing, validation, and deploy-
ment will emerge across the development cycle, reducing risk.
A subset of the authors has formed a BDG seed committee for a globally organized
approach to drive a more cohesive and innovative community from today’s silos of
diverse technologies. The proposed path draws on previous successful initiatives
with considerations that address not only technical barriers but also key soft issues,
such as establishing how the beneﬁts of collaboration through data sharing
outweigh the resulting competitive disincentives. Metrics to gauge success are
also proposed in the supplemental information. Thus, this paper is not only an anal-
ysis of issues with a path to resolution, but also a call to action.
DATA-SCIENCE OPPORTUNITIES CREATE BROAD IMPACTS
History shows that innovation in one area drives rapid growth and innovation broadly
across multiple segments. For example, the human genome created in the HGP

seeded breakthrough innovations in forensic sciences as well as drug discovery. We
assert that opportunities for rapid innovations will similarly be enabled by connect-
ing data-science best practices with the battery community’s deep scientiﬁc,
manufacturing, and deployment capabilities and that this will lead to broad scienti-
ﬁc, societal, and commercial impact. Figure 1 suggests relationships between BDG-
seeded artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) capabilities for various
battery-related data-science objectives and research and commercial impacts as a
function of technology maturity expressed as TRLs as commonly deﬁned by many
organizations including the National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration (NASA)
and other US government agencies.24
AI/ML technology innovation spaces
A comprehensive data-sharing ecosystem will seed a suite of innovative AI/ML tools at
each TRL as in Figure 1. For example, AI/ML materials theory would initially seed ma-
terials discovery, which guides the development of high-yield manufacturing. Next, the
materials data inform appropriate benchtop electrode designs, which provide cell-vali-
dation data that smooths the transition to pilot-line quality control and then transitions

to scale-up followed by mature manufacturing. Providing access to larger and more
diverse datasets as part of the BDG will open up additional AI/ML tools. As clearly
pointed out by Sendek et al., most current ML work in batteries has used limited tools
due to the size of datasets, and increasing the quantity of high-quality data would open
the possibility for deep learning and other high data need methods.25 The ultimate
vision is for a uniﬁed structure that enables the ﬂow of data across the individual seg-
ments—from theory and discovery to deployment and validation.
Impacted communities
Research impacts include theoretical materials discovery, rapid inverse design
where tools directly identify materials that will provide desired functionalities, and
development of new methods for evaluation protocols in laboratories. Commercial
impacts will arise from more abundant, precise, and transferable information and
standardized protocols that collectively accelerate the product-development cycle
across each step. Shorter time frames with more precise and abundant information
reduce risks that slow investments from seed funding, across the various ‘‘valleys of
death’’ and ﬁnally to large manufacturing capital investments which produce hard-
ware for ﬁeld deployments.
One example of the above is the ubiquitous, time-intensive battery-life prediction
step that has been a natural initial target for AI/ML solutions. Recent studies have
used ML methods to predict cycle life using fewer than 100 initial cycles,26–29 to iden-
tify early indicators of Li plating (a major safety concern) by analyzing cycle-by-cycle
electrochemical data,30 and to predict battery end-of-life noninvasively from opera-
tional data without taking systems ofﬂine,29 while synthetic datasets provided in-
sights into degradation paths with reduced experimental burdens.31–33 Similar
studies and opportunities for advancement have also been suggested for calen-
dar-life studies and emerging chemistries.23,34 A study using a more diverse dataset
provides tools that predict life across a broad range of cathode chemistries and elec-
trolyte formulations, which accelerate materials research.28 Another example is the
discovery of new battery materials with targeted properties, which has been signif-
icantly accelerated by inverse design using ML,35,36 and fully autonomous materials
discovery laboratories are now emerging.37–40 Despite the impact of these early
studies, successes are infrequent due in part to limited availability of shared data.
In addition to initial AI/ML life prediction tools, new data-sharing hubs are also
emerging. Often nation-centered, early independent battery-data activities include
those of Battery Archive, BIGMap, Batteries Europe, and the Faraday Institution.
Their diversity of locations and formats underscores the critical need for a singular
approach to improve uniformity.41
BATTERY DATA GENOME ORGANIZING AND OPERATING PRINCIPLES
The BDG faces two signiﬁcant data challenges: (1) heterogeneity—establishing the
data and metadata conventions that will make heterogeneous battery data useful
and enable interoperability; and (2) scale—rapid, large-scale capture of data from
many sources and contributors. The scale challenge is a data-engineering issue
that has been solved in other genomes; the heterogeneity challenge, however, is
more complex and speciﬁc to battery data. Heterogeneity here refers to the broad
spectrum of the most critical information; it arises from multiple phenomena
covering a range of length scales, from molecular to pack dimensions, and time do-
mains from seconds to decades (see Figure 2). Not only are the data naturally
complicated, it also is rapidly evolving as new experimental and developmental
ll

Perspective


--- Page 6 ---

capabilities allow researchers to generate even more diverse data across these spec-
trums at unprecedented scales and precision. The heterogeneity challenge is further
compounded by bench-scale reproducibility, cell-to-cell manufacturing uniformity,
and thermal control. Early efforts at establishing a more uniﬁed ontology to describe
battery data are underway.42 The BDG organizing and operating principles both
expand on the early work and address the foundational challenges from multiple
angles.
Organizing principles
The heterogeneity and scale challenges can both be addressed by organizing the
data into four segments based on the functionality of the component or system un-
der study—an approach that can naturally accommodate variability, while driving
interoperability. The four segments, which are meant to facilitate more uniform
data harvesting and generation, are illustrated in Figure 2 and described below:
(1) Fundamental material and electrode data from studies that probe bulk and
interfacial processes at the atomic and molecular scale,18,43–46 for both mate-
rials discovery and commercial electrodes47–49; this serves as the core set to
support theory development and validate ab initio property predictions from
materials theory. Materials characterization can include electrochemical data
and spectroscopy, X-ray characterization, etc. Electrode characterizations can
include optical, acoustic, post-test tear down, and synchrotron-based
studies.
(2) Full-cell evaluation data reﬂect the interplay among materials, electrodes, cell
designs, and their performance for prototypes50,51 and commercial single
cells.27,52–54 This segment should also include nonelectrochemical data,
such as temperature, pressure, and manufacturing process variations.
(3) Module/pack characterization data reﬂect not only system performance55 but
the ability of the pack and battery management system (BMS) design to
manage cell-to-cell and environmental heterogeneities.
(4) System and ﬁeld data are generated during authentic ‘‘real-life’’ use, which is
usually nonuniform and in contrast to research cycling protocols. Field data
provide insights into the ultimate intended goals and is required to under-
stand gaps between lab and ﬁeld situations. These data are often not openly
available but are critical for the transition to global decarbonization. The in-
formation is generated at the system level, and so approaches will be needed
Figure 2. The four primary segments of the Battery Data Genome

to separate data of the entire system from its many cells and its BMS. The
value of ﬁeld data as a complement to laboratory data—giving insight into
real world battery usage and performance—has been demonstrated in early
examples and is seen as a key to providing better validated models, new tech-
niques, and improved visibility of important data-generation activities which
may be missing.29,56
This approach is designed to support today’s technologies as well as future materials,
chemistries, and device structures. For example, while Li-ion technology is currently a
very active ﬁeld, the organizing principles will translate to emerging Li-metal technol-
ogies, new low-cost aqueous chemistries, ﬂow cells, and the many evolving
approaches to long-duration storage. Early battery data hubs already use these orga-
nizing principles for some of their speciﬁc data types: (1) the Battery Archive, which
provides data for battery degradation studies54,57; (2) the Battery Evaluation and
Early Prediction (BEEP) tools, which focus on optimization of fast-charging protocols
for batteries58; and (3) Galvanalyser, which aims to unify the gathering and querying
of data from different types of battery testers. Furthermore, several emerging data-
bases on fundamental material and electrode segments link battery chemistry to ma-
terial properties59 and electrode microstructure to performance.43,60–63 There are
also databases linking battery information to other phenomena, e.g., various electric
vehicle (EV) battery-lifetime tools64 leveraging open meteorological data65 and drive
cycles.66 These specialized databanks can serve as models and guides to establishing
the structure and metadata requirements for the BDG.
Theoretical data
All four data segments can be bolstered by simulations or generation of ‘‘synthetic data,’’
to complement experimental datasets. This ‘‘close the design loop’’ approach is a critical
strategy to increase innovation pace and efﬁciency by extending experimental results
and analyzing multi-ﬁdelity datasets. Synthetic data examples include ﬁrst principles
atomic calculations, cell-level synthetic data31–33,67 and full-system digital twins. Beneﬁts
of digital twins include the use of physically rooted electrochemical performance and ag-
ing models to generate virtual experimental data (hence ‘‘digital twin’’) which is other-
wise prohibitively costly and time-consuming. Another example is the digitization of
the battery manufacturing process to speed protocols and procedures for both material
development and cell design.68 Synthetic data also provides the opportunity to bench-
mark the predictive performance of ML algorithms. The completely new function the
BDG could offer is to seed partially autonomous laboratories by coordinating experi-
mental and synthetic data access.
Operating principles
The BDG is designed around six key operating principles:
The ﬁrst operating principle, the standards principle, holds that uniform standards
and protocols guide how experiments should be performed, how existing data
can be adapted, what types of data should be collected, and ultimately how we train
researchers. This uniformity is the foundation for interoperability, which is critical for
breakthrough innovations arising from cross-fertilization, and is immediately needed
for both theory and experiments.34,69–77 Success here requires community
consensus both on how data is organized and then on how to implement in both
data generation and acquisition.
The second operating principle, the metadata principle, is that metadata are as
important as performance data. Metadata should include not just detailed
ll
Joule 6, 2253–2271, October 19, 2022 2259
Perspective


--- Page 8 ---

electrochemical information but also the chemical, structural, and physical charac-
teristics of the cells and materials involved in an experiment. Metadata are complex,
exceptionally heterogeneous, and require detailed reporting protocols to insure ad-
equacy and consistency. Full-cell and electrode metadata could include all test con-
ditions, references and protocols, additional characterizations (such as safety), and
experimental control details. Additional details on metadata are in the supplemental
information.
Standardizing metadata while maximizing value, ﬂexibility, and impact is a signiﬁ-
cant challenge. Establishing what information is needed and its format will require
not only extensive community discussion, but also innovations to enable broadest
possible participation. The BDG will manage trade-offs by organizing into layers
of detail: primary, secondary, and tertiary:
 Primary metadata are the minimal mandatory information that must be re-
ported to cover the basic concepts will be structured as a table of contents.
It will include data owners and generators, a unique identiﬁer for each cell,
experimental objective, the nature of the device/s that were tested including
chemistry, and speciﬁc tests. Examples are shown in Table S1.
 Secondary metadata are more comprehensive, with signiﬁcant experimental
details including cell and electrode design, commercial-cell identiﬁcation co-
des, the manner of attachments to test equipment, etc. The journals Joule
and Advanced Energy Materials already have battery experimental reporting
requirements that provide initial concepts.78
 Tertiary metadata refers to highly specialized, nonroutine information that
likely vary substantially between subﬁelds and should be deﬁned by stake-
holder’s consensus—for example, material synthesis protocols and simulation
model parameters.
To facilitate the ease of metadata entry some of the data hubs have started to
develop metadata entry tables and forms which can be more directly used to popu-
late the identiﬁed primary, secondary, and tertiary metadata. While these are in the
early stages of development it can be readily envisioned that future iterations may
evolve to the development of more advanced metadata capture and upload possi-
bilities using tools such as electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs). Developing ELNs
will be aided once each of the classes of metadata are more directly agreed upon
across the BDG community.
The third operating principle, the quality principle, is that all performance and meta-
data must be cleaned, curated, and quality controlled. before submission to a data
hub. This principle is the foundation of ensuring scientiﬁc robustness of the data.
Advancing quality will include developing test protocols from bespoke procedures
used in early research up to rigorous commercial evaluation standards.79,80 It will
also involve developing tools for cleaning data. Examples of widespread challenges
include: (1) signiﬁcant clean-up of time-series current, voltage, time, and tempera-
ture data is already a well-known issue. Open-sourced tools from academic and na-
tional labs (e.g., Battery Data Toolkit) are presently available, but more tools will be
required. Future efforts, including the ranking or grading of datasets based on the
metadata, the quality of the data, and the plausibility (or veriﬁcation) of repeatability
may also evolve as the BDG advances. (2) The location of and funding for efﬁcient
storage and back-up for a large volume of data is an issue that may be partially
solved by support of large organizations, such as funding agencies and philan-
thropic and industry groups.

The fourth operating principle, the sharing principle, states that BDG success does
not require all data to be shared openly, but only that all participants use agreed-
upon standards. To drive participation, there will be a push to align BDG principles
with data reporting to journals and across key government funded activities where
data sharing is reasonable. Additionally, in the early stages of BDG planning, tech-
niques for anonymization of data will be explored. The sharing principle does not
compromise the BDG foundational need for signiﬁcant amounts of data, because
success in any given project requires that only a fraction of the data which is already
stockpiled. Similarly, it does not diminish—in fact, it enhances—impact by encour-
aging broad use of standards without committing to the risk of data exposure in
advance. Figure 3A illustrates sharing principles as several venues for communi-
cating between data sources with different levels of openness. As shown in Fig-
ure 3A, multiple data hubs are loosely grouped based on four data segments
described in the text. For fully open data hubs, information freely ﬂows both be-
tween similar hubs and different data segments of the BDG. It is anticipated that
lower TRL information will tend to be more open. In other data hubs where there
is some level of access restriction, information can still be exchanged but not all
users will have full access.
Figure 3B depicts an example of sharing principles as information ﬂow across seg-
ments and data hubs, both forward and backward in TRL. In this example, a group
of university researchers performing materials discovery develops new material in-
formation that is shared openly with a cell manufacturer. The manufacturer develops
AI/ML-based electrode- and cell-optimization approaches using the university data
plus data from an open-testing data archive and a partially open government data
hub. To contribute back to the BDG, the cell manufacturer shares some of their
cell performance data back to the testing data archive. Manufacturing data is also
shared with a cell integrator. The integrator again uses data from the government
and open data sources and a grid installation to develop ML-informed advanced
controls. Ultimately, the grid developer uses the integrated system with advanced
controls to decarbonize power generation. As a participating member of the
BDG, the developer shares information, which is then used to further optimize future
materials and develop both new, more targeted (and shorter duration) test protocols
and more reﬁned cell and management designs.
Through the coordination provided by BDG operating and organizing principles, the
data sharing is seamless and enables AI/ML tools and common software to be inde-
pendently developed. It is anticipated that much of the higher TRL data will be ano-
nymized, especially ﬁeld and manufacturing information. Other examples related to
BMS development, fast-charge-protocol development, or recycling and second life
can follow similar processes where data ﬂow across data hubs. When coupled with
AI/ML as part of the BDG dramatic reduction in the time from discovery to deploy-
ment is envisioned.
The ﬁfth principle, the software principle, is that at least one complete suite of inter-
operable software must be open-sourced. It would be a missed opportunity to not
reimagine the role of software in a comprehensive vision since fragmented software
development and inaccessibility have hampered battery-data-science advances.

Open and interoperable software tools that enable data management, testing, and
analysis are broadly needed. Interoperability catalyzes the BDG vision by enabling
coordination across (standardized) data hubs and comparison of data against
evolving testing standards; it enables streamlining and uniformity of test procedures
and hardware conﬁgurations across all stages of development and types of analysis.
It is critical that the software be compatible with common tools for plotting, analysis,
and prediction, and other functions.
Open software enables challenge activities to drive further software development—
indeed a virtuous cycle. For example, early community-driven software code efforts
have already contributed to solving some battery-data processing and analysis58,81–86
challenges, including simulation frameworks (e.g., Python Battery Mathematical Model-
ling, PyBAMM81). Yet, signiﬁcant opportunities remain: (1) battery-cycling protocols that
are not standardized or easy to translate between different experimental equipment; (2)
workﬂows for data management—parsing, validation, and sharing—are idiosyncratic
and data formats are highly nonuniform; and (3) AI/ML code for analysis and automation
is a new area, and embryonic code is ad hoc, lacking modularization and interoperability.
Further details on these gaps are provided in the supplemental information.
Existing software projects already have linkages that establish an interconnected
research community with interoperable data tools. Figure 4 offers our proof-of-
concept integration that we developed between complimentary capabilities in the
public-facing data hub Battery Archive,57,87 the private-test-lab database software
Galvanalyser, the data analysis tool BEEP58 and the modeling software PyBAMM81
(described in Github88). Battery Archive provides long-term archival storage and
interactive visualization of cycling data and beneﬁts from data parsers available in
BEEP, and PyBaMM offers a modeling framework for simulating the cycling proto-
cols in silico. Groups at Argonne National Laboratory have developed complemen-
tary algorithms to prepare the data for ML and visualization in the Battery Data
Tool Kit.
The proof of concept shown in Figure 4 suggests a variety of possible workﬂows. For
example, an individual lab uses Galvanalyser to store their battery test data privately
in a local database; they select a subset of these data to be public and transfer it to
Battery Archive and then compare their results against similar tests by other groups
with data also stored on Battery Archive. Another lab subsequently transfers the data
Figure 4. Several open-source packages and data hubs are emerging, and groups are starting to
integrate them to exchange battery data and metadata

from Battery Archive to BEEP to explore charging algorithms and lifetime, and a third
group transfer the data to PyBAMM to develop a new continuum model for battery
degradation. Crucially, we also developed a representational state transfer applica-
tion programming interface (REST API)—a standardized set of rules to enable
communication between different pieces of software—which is already in use to ex-
change information between Battery Archive and Galvanalyser and will also be used
to exchange information with PyBaMM.
These tools are a start, but must be expanded; e.g., BEEP added an importer to process
Battery Archive time-series ﬁles and Battery Archive added an importer for the HDF5
ﬁles generated by the Battery Data Tool Kit. As integration progresses, so does our un-
derstanding of what constitutes primary metadata, and what are the needs for further
development. For example, Battery Archive is now developing tools to make BEEP
directly available through Jupyter Notebook on the BA servers, facilitating easier use
of ML tools. A key outcome from early discussions is that the REST API is now available
as new data hubs appear, as discussed in the operating principles above.
Challenge problems driving community engagement and addressing broad issues
While the organizing and operating principles are rooted in the standardization and
data uniﬁcation needed for harvesting data from across the globe, we realize that
just harvesting data and establishing guidelines is unlikely to be sufﬁcient to drive
success for the BDG and attain the ultimate goal of a reduced carbon future. Still,
it is difﬁcult to determine where data gaps lie. One approach to ensure dataset suf-
ﬁciency is the use of challenge problems, which will be established to use both har-
vested and generated data for the purpose of accelerating tool development and
setting priorities for new data generation. These challenge activities also uniquely
reveal issues and provide a detailed understanding of data gaps.
Until suitable datasets are available for the signiﬁcantly difﬁcult challenge problems,
we suggest a two-tiered approach that balances the need for rapid start driving com-
munity engagement and an expanding scope with greater complexity. Tier 1 chal-
lenges will use currently available data with a key interest in addressing cell life as
shown in the middle of Figure 1. More complex Tier 2 challenges will emerge as appro-
priate open datasets become available and will be focused across the entire develop-
ment cycle from materials discovery to system safety and performance. Each challenge
problem is carefully designed to focus on topics that are difﬁcult to address using data
derived from a single institution, which therefore would require the BDG. The prob-
lems are also speciﬁcally focused on key challenges across the TRL scale shown in Fig-
ure 1. As more explicitly detailed in the supplemental information, to accelerate Tier 2
challenges, the authors are in the planning stage of generating a key dataset that will
include opportunity for both experimental and synthetic data across a range of aging
and use conditions. This tiered approach is seen as a way to both drive early engage-
ment and further expand the data available as part of the BDG.
The present Tier 1 and Tier 2 challenges are dominated by existing Li-ion chemistries
as these offer signiﬁcant data, but there is a critical need for future Tier 2 challenges
to include emerging battery chemistries and designs, especially those for long-dura-
tion storage. Possible areas for future releases include ﬂow-battery electrolyte sys-
tems, materials discovery, other alkali-metal-based chemistries, and multivalent sys-
tems. An example is for an electrode satisfying multiple performance criteria, such as
high or low operating voltage, high working ion capacity and mobility, low expan-
sion on intercalation, and minimal side reactions. The challenge is to satisfy all the
requirements simultaneously while negotiating the trade-offs.

The ﬁrst consideration in challenge problems is the topic areas. As one example we
focus here on cell-level challenges, which can be categorized into performance,
state of health, life, safety, and manufacturing:
(1) Performance: What metadata are most critical for successfully predicting de-
vice performance over a decade of cycling? Are algorithms for one cell chem-
istry extensible to others?
(2) State of health: Can capacity at any point in cell life cycle be estimated from
brief current/voltage excursions? What type of data and models best repre-
sent performance evolution during aging? What limits an algorithm’s ability
to predict future performance in any scenario and at any state of health?
(3) Life: What is the minimum number of cycles needed to predict cycle life (for
example, to 80% of initial capacity) with different accuracies? How do cycle-
life predictions for one use-scenario translate to another; for example, can
fast-charge data predict life for energy arbitrage on the grid? How well do
predictions transfer from one chemistry to another; for example, can Li-ion
NMC-cell data help predict iron phosphate behaviors?
(4) Safety: Is there a signal that indicates an impending thermal runaway? Can the
thermal response of a cell during thermal runaway, as well as cell-to-cell vari-
ation, be predicted based on the properties of a cell (chemistry, format, and
energy and power density)? Can the combination of engineering models, per-
formance data, and ML provide insights into fault-tolerant materials, compo-
nents, and cell designs?
(5) Materials to manufacturing: What are the root causes of cell variability versus
performance metrics such as cycle life in relatively uncontrolled ﬁeld deploy-
ments and temperature resistance? Can manufacturers solve inverse prob-
lems to optimize performance by improving cell design (e.g., electrode
geometry, tab placement, etc.)? Can quantiﬁcation of these uncertainties
be translated to commercially signiﬁcant risk factors in order to catalyze
deployment investments most directly?
Table S2 lists 18 different challenge categories for the community to expand upon
and prioritize. Safety89 and other categories will require broader community discus-
sions to reach consensus on priority directions and need for supporting benchmark
datasets.
BATTERY DATA GENOME: THE PATH FORWARD
The BDG launch is designed as a phased approach facilitated by two global commit-
tees focusing on either technical or commercial impacts which address and so sus-
tain stakeholder interests (Figure 5). The ‘‘scientiﬁc council’’ (green arrow) will
develop technical standards and protocols and drive broad data-science advance-
ments via engagements focused on their community; the ‘‘sustainability council’’
(blue arrow) focuses on economic and commercial issues which complement the
purely technical and which drive sustainability, and it will have a broader stakeholder
mix. Committee memberships should rotate, as do boards of professional societies.
Coordination through community workshops with broad outreach will be vital to es-
tablishing this framework.
Phase 1 focuses on creation of a comprehensive data-science structure via a series of
workshops. More details on the workshops are in the supplemental information,
including those focused on setting standards, a strategy for interoperability, and es-
tablishing a roadmap of increasingly demanding targets to achieve the BDG goals.

Phase 1 involves expanded participation and outreach to increase community
breadth and awareness. It is anticipated that, initially, large portions of the BDG
data will come from the authors of this manuscript. Indeed, using BatteryArchive
as an example, many of the datasets were generated by co-authors of this manu-
script. As other data hubs are developed for different purposes and linked together,
we expect that a similar early trend will occur and that, over time, broad community
engagement will advance. Starting now and advancing to that point in the near
future, methods and protocols to grade and qualify data will be a key focus of the
BDG.
In Phase 2, data hubs are populated with newly published data using software tools
that build in interoperability; several challenge problems as described above and in
the supplemental information, will be run, key benchmark datasets will be devel-
oped (Tables S3 and S4) and roadmaps will be reﬁned. Phase 2 thus becomes a joint
data expansion and core participant sustainment activity. The focus of Phase 3 is tun-
ing the work structure via feedback—ideally from an even broader community. Each
of the phases will require organizational growth and participation. Early efforts
(including those described in the supplemental information) have and will continue
to focus on technical publications and professional meeting workshops and discus-
sions. As the BDG moves from its current early stages in Phase 1 to Phase 3 activities
to engage trade organizations and investment entities, the development of re-
sources for education and building data-reporting practices with key journals to
enhance data submission to the BDG will all become more necessary. The authors
will also lead by example by not only setting the vision and implantation of the
BDG but by actively expanding the data content which resides in BDG data hubs.
The BDG vision and its principles do not inherently lead to sustained activity, even
with initial successes. The sixth principle, the sustainability principle, is that ﬁnancial

and organizational activities must begin in concert with technical activities to ensure
longevity. The two perspectives must be interwoven to synergize as both are of para-
mount importance to an enthusiastic and productive community. The complexity of
this task is high—a viable structure is difﬁcult to predict but exciting to anticipate.
The sustainability committee (blue arrow) will include mature industry, start-ups,
nonproﬁts, investors, and government representatives—several authors of this pa-
per volunteer for the ﬁrst phase. Activities could include:
 Setting an initial 10-year ﬁnancial timeline with: (1) a quick start via seed fund-
ing from government and other agencies including nonproﬁts and philan-
thropy; (2) development of medium-term support via ﬁnancial devices such
as data-sharing fees (open access fees are currently employed by many jour-
nals); and (3) setting a year 5 milestone to create long-term support.
 Establishing a commercial engagement framework to build long-term funding
that supports continued data collection and curation, which are woven into the
BDG design.
An example project with early commercial engagement that can create impact and
coalesce the group might be establishing DERs (distributed energy resources) in
developing economies. Climate change is a global issue but resources to meet
the challenge are nonuniform, with especially large gaps in developing economies
that often depend on philanthropic support. Datasets and open software from the
BDG can help build economically optimized and versatile off-grid power systems
through detailed data that provide an understanding of battery performance and
lifetime.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
We propose the launch of a global battery-data-science initiative, the BDG, for the
transformation of battery innovation to contemporary data-science practices in
research, development, and deployment. The fundamental gap of large open
data resources is solved by creation of data standards and the building a robust com-
munity of interconnected data hubs, with ﬂexible sharing practices and an open suite
of interoperable software. Battery ML and AI advancements will arise from access to
large open datasets and tools. These will drive an unprecedented pace of innova-
tions in research, large-scale manufacturing, and commercial investment that will
catalyze the wide-scale battery deployments needed for deep decarbonization,
including those in developing economies. If even a portion of the gains seen in
similar efforts are realized, such as those of the HGP, the BDG will directly impact
the global population.
There is a precedent, and we offer a plan. Early indicators suggest that initial activ-
ities will not naturally coalesce and that a hesitancy will remain. From this perspec-
tive, we reason that—while the goal of coordinating the global battery community
and launching the BDG may seem grandiose and improbable today—ultimately it
will be realized as a natural step driven by the desire to innovate vigorously, to com-
bat climate change, and to provide energy security with broad economic gains. The
risk is not in moving forward, but in staying as we are now.
